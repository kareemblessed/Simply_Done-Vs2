Task: advanced-task-filtering
SimplyDone FilterBar needs advanced query composition. Implement chainable filter conditions with AND/OR logic operators and persist filter presets to jsonDatabase.
Instructions:
Goal:
- Create FilterQuery type supporting condition composition
- Implement AND/OR logic operators for combining
- Build filterService with buildQuery and executeQuery
- Persist FilterPresets to jsonDatabase adapter
- Extend taskService with filterTasksByQuery method
- Create FilterComposer component for UI interaction
Input:
- Filter conditions: field, operator, value pairs
- Multiple conditions combined with AND or OR
- Filter presets saved as JSON objects
- Example: { field: "priority", operator: "equals" }

Output:
- Filtered tasks array from taskService method
- Persisted presets retrievable from jsonDatabase
- FilterComposer displays active filters and controls
- Success: all 6 tests pass with coverage

Constraints:
- Invalid operators must fail gracefully
- AND/OR operators combine conditions correctly
- Presets survive browser session reloads
- Performance: 1000+ tasks filter under 100ms
- Integrate with existing TaskForm and FilterBar

What will be Tested:
- FilterQuery type with field/operator/value
- buildQuery constructs composite queries
- executeQuery filters with AND logic
- executeQuery filters with OR logic
- FilterPreset saves and loads correctly
- filterTasksByQuery chains with apiService
- Invalid operators rejected gracefully
- Empty conditions return all tasks
- Large result sets filter within timeout
