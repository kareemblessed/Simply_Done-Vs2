-Create undo mechanism for failed operations
-Show loading indicators in TaskItem component

Success_criteria:

-All 9 tests should pass
-UI displays progress (before apiService resolves).
-Previous state restored exactly
-Unsuccessful requests Should be able to be restored to their previous state.
-Several processes queue sequentially.
-Loading indicators should be able to be displayed on TaskItem
-Undo restores state on failure
-Optimistic state matches expected output
