task_description: 
task-010
Extend jsonDatabase with serialization handling circular references, Date field precision, and type validation on deserialization from storage.

requirements:

Add Serializer interface with encode/decode methods
Implement custom Date serialization in jsonDatabase
Detect and handle circular reference detection
Validate Task type on deserialization
Implement IndexedDB fallback for large datasets
Add compression for large task datasets

Success_criteria:

All the 9 tests should pass
Complex Task objects should serialize correctly
Ability for Circular references to be detected and handled
The needs to be date fields deserialize with correct precision
Deserialized objects maintain Task type
IndexedDB fallback triggers correctly
Compressed data decompresses without corruption
Serialization preserves all field types
Large datasets should handle efficiently
To solve the task, a new file should be created src/server/db/serializationAdapter.ts
